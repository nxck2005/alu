# ALUSim

A 32-bit ALU/assembly sim with a web interface for educational purposes.
This does compute!

## Key Features (planned)

- 32-bit
- Support for 3 CPU registers for operations
- 40-row memory and program counter to store programs and data (unified)
- Basic instruction set including:
  - Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, ADC)
  - Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
  - Data movement (LHA, LLA, MOV)
  - Control flow (JMP, JZ, JNZ)
- Planned web interface for:
  - Register states
  - Memory contents
  - System status
