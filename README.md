# ALUSim

A 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) simulator with a web interface for educational purposes. This project provides a visual representation of CPU operations, registers, and memory management.
This does compute!

## Key Features

- 32-bit Architecture
- Three registers (AX, BX, CX)
- 40-row memory
- Basic instruction set including:
  - Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, ADC)
  - Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
  - Data movement (LHA, LLA, MOV)
  - Control flow (JMP, JZ, JNZ)
- Web-based visualization of:
  - Register states
  - Memory contents
  - System status
